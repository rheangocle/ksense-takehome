We would like to provide a short (and hopefully fun) coding challenge to get an idea of the kind of code you are able to write. Please complete the challenge below and submit your results via Indeed chat.

You will be developing a one-page web application that receives JSON data and renders the data into the DOM. You will be using the following API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

You should be able to find the endpoints you need on that page for users, posts, etc.

Using vanilla JS, you will display each 'USER' in a table. When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'. You have full freedom in how you accomplish the above objectives. You also have full freedom as far as design is concerned. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task. Once completed, please upload your code to a Github repo and send us the link via Indeed chat. You must also include a link to a live (hosted) version of your app so we can interact with it and make sure it works. Please don't send us a GitHub repo without also sending a link to the live version.

Note on vanilla JS: We ask that you complete this challenge using Vanilla JS both for test standardization purposes, and so we know you understand the fundementals of JavaScript. Optionally, you may submit an additional React version of this challenge along side your vanilla JS version. This is not required, but it is a good way to show us your React skills.
